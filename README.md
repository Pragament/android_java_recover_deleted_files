# Android Java Recover Deleted Files

## Project Description

This project is an Android application designed to help users recover deleted files from their devices. It scans storage for recoverable files and provides an easy-to-use interface for restoring them.

## Features

- Scan device storage for deleted files (photos, videos, documents, etc.)
- Preview recoverable files before restoring
- Restore selected files to user-specified locations
- User-friendly interface
- Support for multiple file types

## Project Overview for New Contributors

This section provides a high-level overview of the codebase to help new contributors get started quickly.

### Architecture

The project follows a typical Android application structure, primarily written in Java. It consists of the following main components:

- **Frontend (UI):** Built using Android's XML layouts and Java-based Activities/Fragments. Handles user interactions and displays scan/restore results.
- **Backend (Logic):** Java classes handle file scanning, recovery logic, and interaction with device storage.
- **Resources:** Contains images, layouts, and string resources used throughout the app.

### Major Folders & Files

- **`/app/src/main/java/`**  
  Contains all Java source code. Key packages and files include:
  - `activities/` â€” MainActivity and other UI screens.
  - `utils/` â€” Utility classes for file operations and recovery logic.
  - `adapters/` â€” RecyclerView/ListView adapters for displaying lists of files.
- **`/app/src/main/res/`**  
  Android resources:
  - `layout/` â€” XML files defining UI layouts.
  - `drawable/` â€” Images and icons.
  - `values/` â€” Strings, colors, and styles.
- **`AndroidManifest.xml`**  
  Declares app permissions, activities, and services.
- **`build.gradle`**  
  Project and app-level build configuration files.

### Component Interaction

- The UI (Activities/Fragments) triggers scan or recovery actions.
- Utility classes perform file system operations and return results to the UI.
- Adapters display lists of recoverable files.
- Resources provide the visual and textual content for the app.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project for development:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/android_java_recover_deleted_files.git
   cd android_java_recover_deleted_files
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Launch Android Studio.
   - Select "Open an existing project" and choose this folder.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Android Studio will automatically sync and download required dependencies via Gradle.

4. **Run the App Locally**
   - Connect an Android device or start an emulator.
   - Click the "Run" button in Android Studio.

5. **Explore the Codebase**
   - Start with `MainActivity.java` in `app/src/main/java/.../activities/`.
   - Review utility classes in the `utils/` folder for core logic.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add support for more file types
- [ ] Improve scan speed and accuracy
- [ ] Add cloud backup/restore options
- [ ] Enhance UI/UX with modern design
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests
